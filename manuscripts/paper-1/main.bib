abstract = {Various kinds of engineering software and digitalized equipment are widely applied through the lifecycle of industrial products. As a result, massive data of different types are being produced. However, these data are hysteretic and isolated from each other, leading to low efficiency and low utilization of these valuable data. Simulation based on theoretical and static model has been a conventional and powerful tool for the verification, validation, and optimization of a system in its early planning stage, but no attention is paid to the simulation application during system run-time. With the development of new-generation information and digitalization technologies, more data can be collected, and it is time to find a way for the deep application of all these data. As a result, the concept of digital twin has aroused much concern and is developing rapidly. Dispute and discussions around concepts, paradigms, frameworks, applications, and technologies of digital twin are on the rise both in academic and industrial communities. After a complete search of several databases and careful selection according to the proposed criteria, 240 academic publications about digital twin are identified and classified. This paper conducts a comprehensive and in-depth review of these literatures to analyze digital twin from the perspective of concepts, technologies, and industrial applications. Research status, evolution of the concept, key enabling technologies of three aspects, and fifteen kinds of industrial applications in respective lifecycle phase are demonstrated in detail. Based on this, observations and future work recommendations for digital twin research are presented in the form of different lifecycle phases.}

abstract = {While there has been a recent growth of interest in the Digital Twin, a variety of definitions employed across industry and academia remain. There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.}

abstract = {Digital twin, as an effective means to realize the fusion between physical and virtual spaces, has attracted more and more attention in the past few years. Based on ultra-fidelity models, more accurate service, e.g. real-time monitoring and failure prediction, can be reached. Against the background, some scholars studied the related theories and methods on modeling to depict various features of physical objects. Some scholars studied how to use Internet of Things to realize the connections and interactions, thereby keeping the consistency between the virtual and physical spaces. During this process, a new question arises that how to update the models once digital twin models are inconsistent with the practical situations. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a general digital twin model update framework at first. Then, the update methods for multi-dimension models are further explored. The cutting tool is the core component of machine tools which are the key equipment in industry. The precise cutting tool models are essential for realizing the digitalization and servitization of machine tools. Therefore, this paper takes a cutting tool as the application object to discuss how to conduct physics model update based on the proposed framework and methods. Through model update, a more accurate and updated tool wear model could be obtained, which contributes to the prognostics and health management for machine tools.}
