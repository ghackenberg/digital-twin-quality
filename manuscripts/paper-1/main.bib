  abstract = {While there has been a recent growth of interest in the Digital Twin, a variety of definitions employed across industry and academia remain. There is a need to consolidate research such to maintain a common understanding of the topic and ensure future research efforts are to be based on solid foundations. Through a systematic literature review and a thematic analysis of 92 Digital Twin publications from the last ten years, this paper provides a characterisation of the Digital Twin, identification of gaps in knowledge, and required areas of future research. In characterising the Digital Twin, the state of the concept, key terminology, and associated processes are identified, discussed, and consolidated to produce 13 characteristics (Physical Entity/Twin; Virtual Entity/Twin; Physical Environment; Virtual Environment; State; Realisation; Metrology; Twinning; Twinning Rate; Physical-to-Virtual Connection/Twinning; Virtual-to-Physical Connection/Twinning; Physical Processes; and Virtual Processes) and a complete framework of the Digital Twin and its process of operation. Following this characterisation, seven knowledge gaps and topics for future research focus are identified: Perceived Benefits; Digital Twin across the Product Life-Cycle; Use-Cases; Technical Implementations; Levels of Fidelity; Data Ownership; and Integration between Virtual Entities; each of which are required to realise the Digital Twin.}

  abstract  = {The vision of the Digital Twin itself refers to a comprehensive physical and functional description of a component, product or system, which includes more or less all information which could be useful in all---the current and subsequent---lifecycle phases. In this chapter we focus on the simulation aspects of the Digital Twin. Today, modelling and simulation is a standard process in system development, e.g. to support design tasks or to validate system properties. During operation and for service first simulation-based solutions are realized for optimized operations and failure prediction. In this sense, simulation merges the physical and virtual world in all life cycle phases. Current practice already enables the users (designer, SW/HW developers, test engineers, operators, maintenance personnel, etc) to master the complexity of mechatronic systems.},

  abstract = {Digital Twin technology is an emerging concept that has become the centre of attention for industry and, in more recent years, academia. The advancements in industry 4.0 concepts have facilitated its growth, particularly in the manufacturing industry. The Digital Twin is defined extensively but is best described as the effortless integration of data between a physical and virtual machine in either direction. The challenges, applications, and enabling technologies for Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT) and Digital Twins are presented. A review of publications relating to Digital Twins is performed, producing a categorical review of recent papers. The review has categorised them by research areas: manufacturing, healthcare and smart cities, discussing a range of papers that reflect these areas and the current state of research. The paper provides an assessment of the enabling technologies, challenges and open research for Digital Twins.},

abstract = {Digital twin has attracted more and more attentions in the past few years. To put digital twin into practice, modeling is one of the most important foundations. Under this background, some modeling research on digital twin shop-floor which is regarded as the basic unit for realizing smart manufacturing has been carried out. However, current research pays scant attention to the multi-scale features of shop-floor, which hinders the effective application of digital twin shop-floor. As for the problem about how to realize the model construction from the perspective of time-scale and space-scale, this paper firstly proposed a multi-layer modeling framework for supporting model construction from unit layer to system layer to system of system layer. Moreover, the mechanism of model changes over time is also considered. Then, the specific procedures and methods of model assembly, model fusion and model update towards machines and shop-floor are discussed respectively. Finally, a satellite AIT(Assembly, Integration and Test) shop-floor is chosen as the case to validate the correctness and feasibility of proposed framework, procedures and methods.}

abstract = {Digital twin has shown its great application values in various fields in the past few years, especially manufacturing. During the process of digital twin implementation, the digital twin model is one of the most important foundations. Because the effectiveness and accuracy of digital twin models could directly affect the quality of related services. Nowadays, some efforts have been made on digital twin modeling methods, e.g. multi-disciplinary modeling method, multi-dimension modeling method, and multi-scale modeling method. Besides, the research on Industrial Internet of Things makes it possible to realize the synchronization between digital twin models and the corresponding physical objects. However, the attention on how to conduct a comprehensive consistency evaluation between the models and corresponding physical objects is not enough. Against the background, this paper proposed a consistency evaluation framework towards digital twin shop-floor (DTS) models. The consistency evaluation method mainly contains two phases, i.e. before and after model assembly and model fusion. Before model assembly and model fusion, the geometry models, physics models, behavior models, and rule models are mainly considered. After model assembly and fusion, the overall performance of assembled models and fusion models is paid more attention. Furthermore, the analytic hierarchy process(AHP) is used to form a comprehensive consistency evaluation result for DTS models. At last, a specific application scenario in complex product AIT (Assembly, Integration and Test) shop-floor is given to explain how to apply the proposed framework and method.}
