abstract = {Digital twin, as an effective means to realize the fusion between physical and virtual spaces, has attracted more and more attention in the past few years. Based on ultra-fidelity models, more accurate service, e.g. real-time monitoring and failure prediction, can be reached. Against the background, some scholars studied the related theories and methods on modeling to depict various features of physical objects. Some scholars studied how to use Internet of Things to realize the connections and interactions, thereby keeping the consistency between the virtual and physical spaces. During this process, a new question arises that how to update the models once digital twin models are inconsistent with the practical situations. To solve the problem, this paper proposed a general digital twin model update framework at first. Then, the update methods for multi-dimension models are further explored. The cutting tool is the core component of machine tools which are the key equipment in industry. The precise cutting tool models are essential for realizing the digitalization and servitization of machine tools. Therefore, this paper takes a cutting tool as the application object to discuss how to conduct physics model update based on the proposed framework and methods. Through model update, a more accurate and updated tool wear model could be obtained, which contributes to the prognostics and health management for machine tools.}

This paper presents 15 principles of simulation VV&amp;T. These principles help the researchers, practitioners and managers better understand what model VV&amp;T is all about. They serve to provide the underpinnings for the VV&amp;T techniques that can be used throughout the life cycle of a simulation study. This paper also surveys current software VV&amp;T techniques and current simulation VV&amp;T techniques. Understanding and applying these principles and employing proper testing techniques throughout the life cycle of a simulation study are key factors in increasing the probability of success in a simulation study.},
